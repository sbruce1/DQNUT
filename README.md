# DQNUT

Moved by the original [donut.c](https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html), I rewrote in Q, partially with the goal of reducing the number of bytes and partially to see if the vectorized operations would make it rotate faster.

[donut.q](./donut.q) is the donut shaped version, [clean_donut.q](./clean_donut.q) is more readable.
